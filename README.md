# ReinforcementLearningFSharp
Implementation of algorithms and exercises from Sutton and Barto's [Reinforcement Learning book](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book.html) in F#.

The implementation is primarily for the first edition (see [here](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/code/code.html) for the original Common Lisp and MATLAB codes). It was developed primarily using [FsLab](http://www.fslab.org)'s basic template.
